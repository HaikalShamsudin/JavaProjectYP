Assignment 1: Generic Stack
Implement a generic stack class `GenericStack<T>` that supports the following operations:
- `push(T item)`: Pushes an item onto the stack.
- `pop()`: Pops and returns the top item from the stack.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
Test your `GenericStack` class with various data types such as Integer, String, and Double.
