 Assignment 1: Shape Hierarchy
Define an abstract class `Shape` with the following properties and methods:
- Properties: `color` (String), `filled` (boolean)
- Methods: `getArea()` (abstract), `getPerimeter()` (abstract), `toString()` (returns a String representation of the shape)
Create concrete subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` that extend the `Shape` class and implement the necessary methods.
