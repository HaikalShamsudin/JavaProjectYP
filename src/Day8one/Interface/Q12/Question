 Assignment 12: Banking System with Transactions
Extend the `BankAccount` interface from Assignment 2 to include methods for transactions such as `transfer()` (to transfer funds between accounts) and `getTransactionHistory()` (to retrieve transaction history).
Implement these methods in classes `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`. Ensure that transactions are properly recorded and reflected in the account balances.
