Assignment 6: Employee Management System
Create an abstract class `Employee` with the following properties and methods:
- Properties: `name` (String), `id` (int), `salary` (double)
- Methods: `calculateSalary()` (abstract), `displayDetails()`
Create concrete subclasses `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern` that extend the `Employee` class. Implement the `calculateSalary()` method to calculate the salary based on the employee's role, and `displayDetails()` to print out the details of each employee.
