Assignment 13: Remote Sensing System
Create an interface called `Sensor` with methods:
- `void measure()`: Takes a measurement.
- `void calibrate()`: Calibrates the sensor.
Create classes `TemperatureSensor` and `PressureSensor` that implement the `Sensor` interface. Implement methods appropriately for each class.
