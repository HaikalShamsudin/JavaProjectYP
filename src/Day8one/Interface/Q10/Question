 Assignment 10: File Compression Utility
Create an abstract class `CompressionAlgorithm` with a method:
- `void compress(String inputFile, String outputFile)`: Compresses the input file and writes the compressed data to the output file.
Implement concrete subclasses `ZipAlgorithm`, `GZipAlgorithm`, and `LZMAAlgorithm` that extend the `CompressionAlgorithm` class. Implement the compression algorithm in each subclass and test their functionalities.
