 Assignment 8: Payment Gateway Integration
Create an interface called `PaymentGateway` with methods:
- `void processPayment(double amount)`: Processes a payment.
- `boolean isPaymentSuccessful()`: Checks if the payment was successful.
Implement the interface in classes representing different payment gateways like `PayPal`, `Stripe`, etc. Test the payment processing functionality by making payments through different gateways.
