Create an interface called `RemoteControl` with methods:
- `void powerOn()`: Turns on the remote control.
- `void powerOff()`: Turns off the remote control.
- `void volumeUp()`: Increases the volume.
- `void volumeDown()`: Decreases the volume.
Create classes `TVRemote` and `StereoRemote` that implement the `RemoteControl` interface. Implement methods appropriately for each class.
