Assignment 5: Animal Hierarchy
Define an abstract class `Animal` with the following properties and methods:
- Properties: `name` (String), `age` (int)
- Methods: `eat()`, `sleep()`, `makeSound()` (abstract)
Create concrete subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` that extend the `Animal` class and implement the `makeSound()` method to produce appropriate sounds for each animal.
These assignments should provide you with a good opportunity to practice implementing and working with Java interfaces and abstract classes.
Absolutely! Here are ten more assignments to further deepen your understanding of Java interfaces and abstract classes:
