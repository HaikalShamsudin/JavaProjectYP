 Assignment 15: Music Streaming Service
Define an interface called `MusicPlayer` with methods:
- `void play()`: Plays the current track.
- `void pause()`: Pauses the current track.
- `void next()`: Plays the next track.
- `void previous()`: Plays the previous track.
Create classes `MP3Player` and `StreamingServicePlayer` that implement the `MusicPlayer` interface. Implement methods appropriately for each class.
